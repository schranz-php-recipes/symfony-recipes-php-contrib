  * Now you need to make some manually changes:

    Add the config/packages/security.yaml.dist to your yaml file
        mv config/packages/security.yaml.dist config/packages/security.yaml

    Run doctrine migrations
        php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff --namespace=\"DoctrineMigrations\"
        php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate -n

    Create a user
        php bin/console sfs:user:create username email password

    Promote the user to admin if you want
        php bin/console sfs:user:promote username
